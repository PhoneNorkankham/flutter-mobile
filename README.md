## Guide to building apps

- Start the emulator you want to test or the real device

The application needs to be completely filled in to build. This means that the full build command is:

For Android:

```shell
flutter run --flavor [flavor] --dart-define-from-file=.env/[flavor].json
```

For iOS:

```shell
flutter run --flavor [flavor]
```

with `[flavor]` is `dev` or `prod`

## Rebuilding to generated files (Serialization, Retrofit, Moor)

The project uses a number of libraries that automatically generate code (files with extension `g.dart`), such as retrofit, json_serialization and others.
When there is a change in the code affecting these files, the following command must be executed to recreate them:

```shell
dart run build_runner build
```

If you get an error message about deleting conflicting outputs, run:

```shell
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

If repeatedly making changes affecting these auto-generated files, run:

```shell
dart run build_runner watch
```

## Rebuilding the app icons

The app icons are built through `flutter_launcher_icons` and the main files are in the `assets/app_icons` folder. 
To rebuild icons after updating the main file, just run:

```shell
dart run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

The `flutter_launcher_icons` configuration resides in the `flutter_launcher_icons.yaml` file.

## Rebuilding assets

Assets are built through `assets_gen` and the main files are in the `assets/` folder.
To rebuild icons after updating the main file, just run:

```shell
dart run assets_gen build
```

The `assets_gen` configuration resides in the `assets_gen.yaml` file.

## App Architecture

The overall app architecture can be summed up in these plugins:

- [Drift](https://pub.dev/packages/drift) for the local sqlite database
- [Retrofit](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit) for REST API
- [JsonSerializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) for generating models
- [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for our state management (refactor is ongoing)
